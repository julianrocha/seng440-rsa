There should be a concept of bignum and double bignum.
Multiplication inherently doubles width, we must be able to deal with both. (in the same code)
We need a custom operation:
	- mult_mod
	- bignum * bignum = hugenum
	- hugenum % bignum = bignum

Possible solution
- generalize functions to handle arbitraty length int arrays (realistically will only handle single and double)
- do away with structs
- add some helper init functions
- write the custom function

Question
- does any function need to handle 2 sizes at once?

- mult
	- huge_num+huge_num -> hugenum
- div_mod
	- div : huge_num / big_num -> huge_num
	- mul : huge_num * big_num ->
